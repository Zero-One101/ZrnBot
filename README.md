# ZrnBot
An IRC bot written in C# and IronPython

This IRC bot is designed to be extensible. Core functionality, such as network handling, is written in C#. Functions that the bot can perform will be written in Python. This will allow for existing functionality to be modified, and new functionality to be written, without having to build a new version of the bot, or take the bot offline for any period of time.
